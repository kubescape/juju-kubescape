summary: |
  This charm deploys Kubescape to enhance the security of a Kubernetes cluster.

description: |
  This charm installs the Kubescape Operator, a solution that enhances the
  security of Kubernetes clusters by monitoring them for issues and helping fix
  them.

  Kubescape is a K8s open-source tool providing a Kubernetes single pane of
  glass, including risk analysis, security compliance, RBAC visualizer, and
  image vulnerability scanning. Kubescape scans K8s clusters, YAML files, and
  HELM charts, detecting misconfigurations according to multiple frameworks
  (such as the NSA-CISA, MITRE ATT&CKÂ®), software vulnerabilities, and RBAC
  (role-based-access-control) violations at early stages of the CI/CD pipeline,
  calculates risk score instantly and shows risk trends over time.

  This charm will help DevSecOps, Security Engineers and CISOs review and
  constantly monitor the security posture of their Kubernetes clusters and help
  fix the found issues by offering remediation where possible.
